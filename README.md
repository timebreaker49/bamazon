# bamazon

## Welcome to bamazon! A basic CLI node application. Let's get this started. 

Make sure to run the .sql file before proceeding. Once everything is set up, just run by typing the below.
![run command!](images/node_command.PNG "run command")

When the app starts up, the products available for purchase will appear (I looked up random electronics products on Amazon).
![view all products!](images/view_all_products.PNG "view all products")

The user is then prompted for the name of the product they wish to buy.
![select product!](images/select_product.PNG "select product")

Upon selecting which product they'd like to buy, the customer is asked what quantity of the item they want to purchase.
![select quantity!](images/select_quantity.PNG "select quantity")

The quantity desired is checked against the database and if there are enough available, the customer is shown the sales total, having purchased the items. 
![checkout!](images/checkout.PNG "checkout")
